        <p>Thanks for taking the time to check out my portfolio! If you didn’t know by now my name is Erik and I’m a Designer from Cleveland, OH. A couple years ago, after receiving my BFA in Graphic Design, I moved out west to the SF bay area. My skills include UI/UX Design, Product Design and Branding/Identity. I also dabble in Front-End Development.</p>
