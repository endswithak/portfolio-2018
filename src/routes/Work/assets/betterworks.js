The purpose of this resource is to help increase efficiency across all media channels and departments at BetterWorks by providing a common language around their UI patterns. It gives any team member the ability to quickly surface existing solutions when working on a new page or feature. This allows for more maintainable code and visual consistency across the entire product.'
