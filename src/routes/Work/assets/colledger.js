    "Colledger, an interactive college search tool focused heavily on data visualization, was created in response to our nation's ever-growing student loan debt crisis. Colledger's goal is to make institutions of higher learning as transparent as possible. To do this Collegder centralizes the multitudes of figures and statistics already made public by these institutions, and displays them in an understandable, intuitive, and appealing manner. By doing this, Colleger hopes to strengthen the students understanding of a college investment, and in turn spur smarter decisions when it comes time to commit."
