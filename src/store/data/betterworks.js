    `BetterWorks is an enterprise startup focused on creating
    the easiest way to set and manage goals. Their product takes
    advantage of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and Goal Science
    to engage and align high performing teams.`,
    `The BetterWorks style guide was created through close collaboration
    with the BetterWorks Design and Engineering teams. The purpose of
    this resource is to help increase efficiency across all media channels
    and departments at BetterWorks by providing a common language around
    their UI patterns. It gives any team member the ability to quickly
    surface existing solutions when working on a new page or feature.

    across the entire product.`
