  'description': [
    `Colledger, an interactive college search tool focused heavily
    on data visualization, was created in response to our nation's
    ever-growing student loan debt crisis. Colledger's goal is to
    make institutions of higher learning as transparent as possible.
    To do this Collegder centralizes the multitudes of figures and
    statistics already made public by these institutions, and displays
    them in an understandable, intuitive, and appealing manner. By
    doing this, Colleger hopes to strengthen the students understanding
    of a college investment, and in turn spur smarter decisions when
    it comes time to commit.`
