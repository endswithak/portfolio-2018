  'description': [
    `Electwitch (Electron + Twitch) is a desktop application I designed and developed as a side project while working at Twitch. Before Twitch had a desktop application, the only way to view broadcasts was on their web and mobile applications. Around the same time, JavaScript libraries like React, Redux, and Electron started to shine. Along with this, larger companies started to adopt their own design systems, with Googleâ€™s Material Design being at the forefront. Combining my love of Product Design and Front-End Development, I decided to take these technologies and create a Twitch desktop application catered to my design aesthetic and viewing preferences. Some more well known applications that take advantage of these technologies include Facebook, Discord, and Slack to name a few.`
