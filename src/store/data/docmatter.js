  'snippet':`An introduction to DocMatter's branding and web application.`,
  'description': [
    `DocMatter is a healthcare startup focused on creating collaboration
    software for medical professionals. It provides an array of services
    which aim to increase collaboration and learning among the
    medical community.`,
    `The new DocMatter brand identity was crafted through close collaboration
    with the DocMatter founders. Being the sole designer, it was my job to
    bring their ideas to life. Branding is that split-second feeling you have
    about a product. It’s not just a logo and color palette; It’s a system of
    experiences created through smart design and strategy. For DocMatter, the
    strategy was simple. It had to clean and professional.`,
    `The color palette is a combination of dark gray, white, and dark red.
    The dark gray hue acts as the primary and the dark red acts as the accent.
    The dark gray gives an impression of elegance and modernism, while the dark
    red gives an impression of energy and importance. When combined with the
    cleanliness of a healthy amount of white, these colors give a very
    professional impression.`,
    `Creating the logo was a fun challenge. Along with sticking to the brand
    guidelines, it also had to be memorable and versatile. The final logo is
    a combo mark that combines the DocMatter word mark with the medical cross
    symbol. The “Doc” is stacked on top of the “Matter” in a way that creates
    a doctor icon with the “o” of “Doc” and “M” of “Matter”. The medical cross
    acts as an accent to help tie it all together. The doctor icon may not be
    apparent at first glance, but thats by design. It works similar to the arrow
    in the FedEx logo. If you’re thinking “But Erik, there is no arrow in the
    FedEx logo!”; I can assure you there is. Just google it and wait for your
    mind to be blown. It’s through these moments of discovery that make
    a logo memorable.`
