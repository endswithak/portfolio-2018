// Settings – used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
@import './settings/settings.globb'

// Tools – globally used mixins and functions.
// It’s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.
@import './tools/tools.globb'

// Generic – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc.
// This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.
@import './generic/generic.globb'

// Elements – styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.).
// These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.
@import './elements/elements.globb'

// Objects – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns,
// for example media object known from OOCSS.
// Common component styles
@import './objects/objects.globb'

// Components – specific UI components. This is where majority of our work takes
// place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components.
// Component styles are treated as css modules and should not be imported into base styles.
// Each component stylesheet will import the base styles with the webpack sass-loader data option.

// Utilities – utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything
// which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class.
@import './utilities/utilities.globb'
